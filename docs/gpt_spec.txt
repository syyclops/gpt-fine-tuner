Write a technical specification for a UI to fine tune gpt-3. The purpose is to fine tune to be a model for building science and building engineering. Engineers would ask it questions and say how good the responses are and this should be used as a feedback loop to fine tune a model. 
Technical Specification for a UI for Fine-Tuning GPT-3 for Building Science and Engineering

Introduction:
The purpose of this UI is to fine-tune the GPT-3 language model for building science and engineering applications. Engineers will be able to ask the model questions and provide feedback on the quality of the responses. This feedback will be used in a closed loop to continuously improve the model.

User interface:
The user interface will be a web-based application, with a simple and intuitive design. It will have the following components:

A text input field for the user to enter questions.
A text area to display the model's response.
A rating system for the user to rate the quality of the response.
A submit button to send the feedback to the model.
Data Collection:
The feedback provided by the users will be collected in a database. The data will include the user's question, the model's response, and the rating provided by the user. This data will be used to fine-tune the model.

Model Fine-Tuning:
The collected data will be used to fine-tune the GPT-3 model. The fine-tuning process will be carried out using the OpenAI API. The model will be fine-tuned on a regular basis, with the frequency of fine-tuning being determined by the volume of feedback received.

Security:
The collected data will be securely stored and the access to the data will be restricted to authorized personnel only. The data will not be shared with any third party.

Technical Requirements:

Web Server: Apache or Nginx
Backend: Python Flask
Database: MySQL or PostgreSQL
OpenAI API
Conclusion:
This UI will provide engineers with a convenient and effective way to fine-tune the GPT-3 model for building science and engineering applications. The collected data and fine-tuning process will ensure that the model continually improves and provides high-quality responses.

will asking it questions and rating the answers help fine tune gpt to learn more about buildings and engineering?
Yes, asking questions and rating the answers can help fine-tune GPT-3 to learn more about buildings and engineering. The feedback collected from the ratings will be used to train and update the model, allowing it to learn from the experience and improve its responses over time. This process is known as fine-tuning, and it allows GPT-3 to adapt to specific domains and improve its performance in those areas. In this case, the feedback loop of asking questions and rating answers will provide a means for the model to learn more about buildings and engineering, leading to better and more accurate responses over time.

some me an example use case
An example use case of the fine-tuned GPT-3 model for building science and engineering could be as follows:

An engineer is designing a new building and wants to know the best material to use for the roof. The engineer would ask the fine-tuned GPT-3 model: "What is the best material to use for a roof in a building?"

The model would respond with several options, such as "asphalt shingles," "metal roofing," "Clay tiles," etc.

The engineer would then rate the quality of the response and provide additional feedback, such as "Metal roofing is the best option for my needs." This feedback would be used to further fine-tune the model and improve its responses in the future.

In this way, the fine-tuned GPT-3 model would act as an assistant to the engineer, providing relevant information and helping to inform the design process. Over time, as more questions are asked and feedback is provided, the model will continue to improve and become an increasingly useful tool for building science and engineering applications.

show how the rating of quality and feedback would be stored in a postgres database, with the inital question and response. And then how it will get fed back into gpt to be fine tuned
Here's an example of how the rating of quality and feedback would be stored in a PostgreSQL database, along with the initial question and response, and then how it would get fed back into GPT-3 to be fine-tuned:

Storing data in the database:
The initial question and response would be stored in the database, along with a unique identifier for the query.
The user would rate the quality of the response on a scale of 1 to 5, and this rating would also be stored in the database, along with the unique identifier for the query.
The feedback provided by the user would be stored in the database as well, and linked to the query using the unique identifier.
Feeding the data back into GPT-3:
The collected data would be used to fine-tune the GPT-3 model.
The fine-tuning process would involve retraining the model on the collected data, adjusting the model's parameters to improve its accuracy.
This process would be performed on a regular basis, and the frequency of fine-tuning would depend on the volume of feedback received.
After each fine-tuning process, the updated model would be used for answering questions from users, and the feedback loop would continue.
In this way, the feedback loop of asking questions, rating responses, and using the data to fine-tune the model would allow GPT-3 to continuously improve its understanding of building science and engineering, leading to better and more accurate responses over time.

give me the postgres database structure for this, tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, etc.
Here's an example of the PostgreSQL database structure for storing the questions, responses, ratings, and feedback:

sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE queries (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  question TEXT NOT NULL,
  response TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now() NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE ratings (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  query_id INTEGER REFERENCES queries(id) NOT NULL,
  rating INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (rating BETWEEN 1 AND 5),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now() NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE feedback (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  query_id INTEGER REFERENCES queries(id) NOT NULL,
  feedback TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now() NOT NULL
);
The queries table will store the questions and responses, along with a unique identifier (id) and a timestamp of when the query was made (created_at).
The ratings table will store the ratings given by users, along with a unique identifier (id), the identifier of the query to which the rating belongs (query_id), and a timestamp of when the rating was made (created_at).
The feedback table will store the feedback given by users, along with a unique identifier (id), the identifier of the query to which the feedback belongs (query_id), and a timestamp of when the feedback was made (created_at).
The relationships between the tables are defined using foreign keys. In this case, query_id in both ratings and feedback tables is a foreign key that references the id column in the queries table. This ensures that each rating or feedback belongs to a specific query, and that the data remains consistent and well organized in the database.

now show how to use the open ai fine tuning api to feed this data back into the model
Fine-tuning GPT-3 using the OpenAI API would typically involve the following steps:

Collecting the data:
The data stored in the PostgreSQL database, including the questions, responses, ratings, and feedback, would need to be exported into a format that can be used for fine-tuning.
This could involve writing a script to extract the data from the database and convert it into a suitable format, such as a JSON file.
Preparing the data for fine-tuning:
The data exported from the database would need to be preprocessed to ensure that it is in the correct format for fine-tuning.
This could involve transforming the data into a format that can be used as input to the OpenAI API, such as converting the questions and responses into a sequence of tokens.
Fine-tuning the model:
Once the data has been prepared, it can be used to fine-tune the GPT-3 model using the OpenAI API.
The OpenAI API provides a simple interface for fine-tuning the model, allowing developers to specify the data and the parameters for the fine-tuning process.
Here is an example of how to use the OpenAI API to fine-tune GPT-3 using Python:

makefile
Copy code
import openai

# Use the OpenAI API key to authenticate the API
openai.api_key = "<API_KEY>"

# Load the preprocessed data
data = "<DATA_FILE>.json"

# Specify the parameters for the fine-tuning process
model_engine = "text-davinci-002"
n = 1
max_tokens = 2048
temperature = 0.5

# Start the fine-tuning process
response = openai.Engine.run(
    engine=model_engine,
    prompt=data,
    n=n,
    max_tokens=max_tokens,
    temperature=temperature
)

# Store the fine-tuned model
model = response["model"]
openai.Model.save(model, "<MODEL_NAME>")
In this example, the openai library is used to interact with the OpenAI API. The API key is specified using openai.api_key, and the preprocessed data is loaded into the data variable. The parameters for the fine-tuning process, such as the model engine, number of responses, maximum number of tokens, and temperature, are specified in the run method of the Engine class. The fine-tuned model is then stored using the save method of the Model class.

Should I give it the ability to have conversation? Meaning after the ask a question and it answers, they rate the answer and submit feedback, should I allow another question to be based off the first one? 

Or will it be better to just allow one question for the fine tuning process? 
Whether to allow for multi-turn conversations as part of the fine-tuning process depends on the specific requirements of your application and the desired outcome.

If the goal is to fine-tune the model for more natural and conversational responses, allowing for multi-turn conversations can be beneficial. In this case, the model would learn how to generate responses that are coherent and relevant across multiple turns, based on the previous context and the user's questions and feedback. This could help to improve the overall quality of the model's responses.

However, allowing for multi-turn conversations can also make the fine-tuning process more complex, as the model would need to keep track of the context across multiple turns and generate responses that are coherent with the previous interactions.

If the goal is to fine-tune the model for a specific use case, such as answering technical questions about building engineering, it may be more effective to focus on fine-tuning the model for individual questions. This would allow for more targeted and focused fine-tuning, and would simplify the fine-tuning process.

Ultimately, the choice between allowing for multi-turn conversations or focusing on individual questions will depend on the specific requirements of your application and the desired outcome.

Update the requirements to allow for multi turn conversations 
Here is an updated technical specification for a UI to fine-tune GPT-3 for building science and building engineering, with support for multi-turn conversations:

User interface:
The UI should allow engineers to ask questions about building science and building engineering and receive responses from the fine-tuned GPT-3 model.
The UI should also allow the engineer to rate the quality of the model's response and provide feedback.
The UI should store the questions, responses, ratings, and feedback in a database for use in fine-tuning the model.
The UI should support multi-turn conversations, where the engineer can ask follow-up questions based on the previous context and the model's responses.
Database:
The database should store the questions, responses, ratings, and feedback from the engineers.
The database should have the following tables:
conversations: This table should store information about each conversation, including a unique identifier for the conversation and the timestamp of the conversation.
turns: This table should store information about each turn in the conversation, including the conversation identifier, the question, the response, the rating, and the feedback.
The database should have the following relationships:
A conversation can have multiple turns (one-to-many relationship between conversations and turns tables)
Each turn should be associated with a single conversation (many-to-one relationship between turns and conversations tables)
The primary key for the conversations table should be a unique identifier for the conversation.
The primary key for the turns table should be a unique identifier for the turn, which could be generated automatically by the database.
The turns table should have a foreign key relationship with the conversations table, based on the conversation identifier.
Fine-tuning process:
The fine-tuning process should use the data stored in the database, including the questions, responses, ratings, and feedback, to fine-tune the GPT-3 model.
The fine-tuning process should be triggered regularly, such as once a day, to incorporate the latest data into the model.
The fine-tuning process should use the OpenAI API to fine-tune the GPT-3 model.
The fine-tuning process should preprocess the data to ensure that it is in the correct format for fine-tuning, such as converting the questions and responses into a sequence of tokens.
The fine-tuning process should store the fine-tuned model for use in the UI.
This updated technical specification should provide a foundation for building a UI that allows for fine-tuning GPT-3 for building science and building engineering, with support for multi-turn conversations.

Give me the postgres database structure (tables, columns, primary keys, foriegn keys, etc) for this multi turn conversation
Here is the database structure for storing multi-turn conversations:

conversations table:
id: unique identifier for the conversation (primary key)
timestamp: timestamp of the start of the conversation
turns table:
id: unique identifier for the turn (primary key)
conversation_id: identifier for the conversation associated with this turn (foreign key referencing conversations table)
question: the question asked by the engineer
response: the response from the GPT-3 model
rating: the rating provided by the engineer for the quality of the response
feedback: any additional feedback provided by the engineer about the response
Here's an example of how the data could be stored in these tables:

conversations table:

3  | 2               | What is the tensile      | Steel has a high tensile | 3      | The response
   |                 | strength of steel?       | strength.                |        | should have
   |                 |                           |                           |        | mentioned
   |                 |                           |                           |        | specific
   |                 |                           |                           |        | values.
This database structure provides a way to store and track the multiple turns of a conversation, with each turn being linked to a specific conversation and having associated question, response, rating, and feedback.

How will I feed the conversation into gpt-3, especially if it is longer than the 4000 token limit
The GPT-3 API has a token limit of 4096 tokens, so if the conversation is longer than this, you will need to break it up into multiple inputs and make multiple API calls. Here's a high-level overview of how you can feed the conversation into GPT-3:

Retrieve the conversation data from the database.
Split the conversation into chunks of 4096 tokens or less.
For each chunk, create a context input for the GPT-3 API that includes the previous question and response, the current question, and any relevant context or history from the previous turns in the conversation.
Make a request to the GPT-3 API to generate a response for the current chunk.
Store the response along with the associated rating and feedback in the database.
Repeat this process for each chunk of the conversation.
This way, you can feed the entire conversation into GPT-3 and fine-tune the model based on the engineer's ratings and feedback.
